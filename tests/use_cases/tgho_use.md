### Lake Taupo

Station tgho is operated by GNS in New Zealand.  It is on Lake Taupo.

The receiver does not track L2C and it is not clear to me that L5 data are available. However, Glonass L1 and L2 are 
tracked, which is a good thing. It uses a geodetic sampling rate - 30 sec - which is not great but acceptable for this 
reflector height, which appears to be ~ 4 meters.

Let's make a SNR file and take a quick look at the spectral characteristics. Because of all the 
clutter at the site and the dielectric constant of water, I am going to emphasize the lower elevation angles.

*rinex2snr tgho 2020 300 -archive nz*

*quickLook tgho 2020 300 -e1 5 -e2 15*

There is a lot of clutter at the small RH values.  So try again, windowing:

*quickLook tgho 2020 300 -e1 5 -e2 15 -h1 2 -h2 8*

Why don't I like L2 data?

Now make a SNR file that includes both GPS and Glonass:

*rinex2snr tgho 2020 303 -archive nz -orb gps+glo*

Look at the Glonass L1 results. Very nice.

*quickLook tgho 2020 303 -e1 5 -e2 15 -fr 101 -h1 2 -h2 8*

You need to set an azimuth mask at this site. I will rely on the work of
Lucas Holden at RMIT. Currently this needs to be done by hand-editing the json.
So, first make the standard json, but with some changes to reflector height, peak2noise 
and elevation angle settings:

*make_json_input tgho -38.8130   175.9960  385.990 -h1 2 -h2 8 -e1 5 -e2 15 -peak2noise 3.2*

Hand edit to only look at L1, Glonass L1 (freq 101) and Glonass L2 (freq 102) and 
include an azimuth mask. [Sample json here](tgho.json).
Note that I increased the required amplitude to 9 for all frequencies. 

Now let's run a longer dataset for this site to see what Lake Taupo is up to,
say 5/9/2020 through 11/14/2020. Use **ymd** to find the day of year for these dates.
Make sure you ask for the NZ archive and the correct orbits:

*rinex2snr tgho 2020 130 -archive nz -doy_end 319 -orb gps+glo*

Then analyze the data:

*gnssir tgho 2020 130 -doy_end 319 -screenstats False*

Of course if you want some screenstats, you can leave that part out.

Remember, the RH results are in $REFL_CODE/2020/results/tgho. Since this is a lake, you can 
use **daily_avg** to give you a daily value. I used this command:

*daily_avg tgho 0.25 50*

As noted by Lucas, the number of RH retrievals is significantly smaller on days when the wind speeds are high.
High winds == rough surface == less specular. We are being conservative here and requiring 50 measurements/day for a daily average.
